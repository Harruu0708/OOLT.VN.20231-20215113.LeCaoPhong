1. What class should implement the Comparable interface?
- Media class implements Comparable interface
2. In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method to reflect the ordering that
   we want?
   public int compareTo(Media o) {
   		// TODO Auto-generated method stub
   		if (this.title.compareTo(o.title) == 0) {
   			return Float.compare(this.cost, o.cost);
   		}
   		return this.title.compareTo(o.title);
   	}
3. Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this
   Comparable interface approach?
- No,we can't have two ordering rules of the item
4. Suppose the DVDs have a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then
   decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
    	public int compareTo(Media o) {
   		if (o instanceof CD) {
   			CD cd = (CD) o;
   			if (this.getTitle().compareTo(cd.getTitle())== 0) {
   				if (this.length == cd.length) {
   					return Float.compare(this.getCost(), o.getCost());
   				}
   				return Integer.compare(this.length, cd.length);
   			}
   			return this.getTitle().compareTo(cd.getTitle());
   		}
   		return super.compareTo(o);
   	}
