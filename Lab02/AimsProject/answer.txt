10. If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title
then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
-No, In Java, we cannot have two constructors with the same parameter types.
This means that we cannot have one constructor that takes a title and another constructor
that takes a category with the same data type (e.g., String).

14. Try to add a method addDigitalVideoDisc which allows to pass an arbitrary
number of arguments for dvd. Compared to an array parameter. What do you prefer in this case?
- My preference is to utilize an array parameter because it offers better clarity and convenience.
I don't need to list all DVDs individually; instead, I can simply pass an array of DVD objects.

15.
Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
-In Java, method parameters are Pass by Value, meaning we pass a copy of the variable's value, not a reference to the original variable.
This means that when we modify the parameter's value inside the method, it doesn't affect the value of the original variable passed into the method.

After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
-Due to the swap method, only the values of the two parameters are swapped, not the objects themselves.
The objects retain their original values.

After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
- The changeTitle method modifies the title of
the object provided as a parameter by invoking setTitle() method.
